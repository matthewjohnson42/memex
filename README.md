# memex

A monorepo containing the constituent components of a software system that provides text entry and retrieval functionality via a web UI.

The repository contains the following components:


- memex-service

- memex-ui

- memex-data-service


Each of the components have their own README. The software system uses the underinformed design of program integration across its data access and user authentication functionalities, providing both data endpoints and authentication endpoints via the memex-service system component.

The repository also contains the following library:

- memex-spring-data

The system is not currently in use, but had previously been deployed to AWS on a Kubernetes single node cluster, which was initialized by the configurations and scripts in the [matthewjohnson42/kubernetes-standalone](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/kubernetes-standalone) repository.


To use the system locally:
 - Install system level dependencies
   - Java 11 with JAVA_HOME set
   - Docker daemon (any version)
   - npm version 10 (packaged with Node version 22)
 - Start the memex-service
   - Open a CLI and change directory to memex-service/docker, then run the [memex-service/docker/docker-compose-up.sh](memex-service/docker/docker-compose-up.sh) script.
   - Provide responses to the input prompts as follows:
     - Username and password: any value, but will be needed later
     - Encryption secrets:    any value, including 0 character strings
     - Spring active profile: 'dev', without quotes
 - Start the memex-ui
   - Open a CLI and change directory to memex-ui/docker, then run the [memex-ui/docker/docker-compose-up.sh](memex-ui/docker/docker-compose-up.sh) script.
 - Access the app via web browser at http://localhost:4200
   - Click any button to prompt a login
   - Login using the user name and password that were entered when starting the memex-service

If the application starts but authentication fails with a 401 response, a possible cause of failure is the incorrect population of the Mongo userDetails collection. To resolve the issue, use the `getEncryptedPassword` endpoint to encrypt a password, enter a new object in to the memex.userDetails Mongo collection with the encrypted password in the "password" variable and any value in the "username" variable, and then reattempt login using the entered username and the password submitted to the encryption endpoint.

Using the app:
   - Select the plus sign to create a new entry.
   - Type in the darker grey text box to populate the entry.
   - Use the search function in the 'Retrieval' tab to retrieve entries, where no search string returns all entries, and where typos of up to 1 character are permitted (see the 'fuzziness' variable in the `RawTextESRestTemplate` class of the memex-spring-data library)
   - Delete entries by wiping out the content in the UI or by removing the entry from Mongo
